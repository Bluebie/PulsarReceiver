      -=- Pulsar Receiver License -=-

=== Rules: ===

 -> If you make a thing with Pulsar Receiver
    code inside it, and you then sell it or
    give it to someone, you need to give me
    attribution, like this:
      
           Some code from Jenna Fox
           http://creativepony.com/
    
    The attribution needs to be visible to
    the user of the thing. Examples: In a
    readme, on some packaging...
    
 -> You can't use the name 'Pulsar' at all
    unless I've given you permission. The
    name is for my stuff, not yours.

=== Things I would really like you to do: ===

 -> If you're selling thingies with my code
    in them, and you make a bunch of money,
    it'd be totally awesome if you emailed
    and offered me one of your thingies!
              I love stuff!

 -> If you make a cool project using this,
    I'd love to see photos/videos of it!

 -> You should totally document your thingy
    and share the plans online as open
    source hardware. Pay it forward. ^_^
